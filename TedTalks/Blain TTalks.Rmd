```{r}
### Load required packages:
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```

```{r}
### Read in metadata:
ted_main <- read_csv("~/skewl/text_analysis/text-mining-in-class-team6/TedTalks/ted_main.csv")

### Read in lecture transcripts:
transcripts <- read_csv("~/skewl/text_analysis/text-mining-in-class-team6/TedTalks/transcripts.csv")

### Fix url formatting so the two data sets match:
transcripts$url = str_replace_all(transcripts$url, pattern = "\r", replacement = "")
```

```{r}
### Combine data sets and change to token format for sentiment analysis:
combined = inner_join(ted_main, transcripts, by = "url")

transcripts_clean = combined %>% unnest_tokens(output = word, input = transcript)

```
